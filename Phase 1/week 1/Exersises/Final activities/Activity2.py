# Activity 2: Library Management System (Intermediate Level)
# Task
    # Create a library system with Book and Library classes that interact with each other.
# Requirements
    # Book Class

    # Attributes: title, author, isbn, is_available, borrower, due_date
# Methods:

    # __init__(self, title, author, isbn)
    # borrow(self, borrower_name) - marks book as borrowed
    # return_book() - marks book as available
    # is_overdue() - checks if book is overdue (assume 14 days from borrow date)
    # __str__() and __repr__()



# Library Class

    # Attributes: name, books (list of Book objects)
# Methods:

    # __init__(self, name)
    # add_book(self, book) - adds a Book object to the library
    # find_book(self, title) - returns Book object if found
    # borrow_book(self, title, borrower) - borrows a book by title
    # return_book(self, title) - returns a book by title
    # get_available_books() - returns list of available books
    # get_overdue_books() - returns list of overdue books

# claude Review

# Good progress on Activity 2! You've got the basic structure working, but there are several issues to address. Let me give you detailed feedback:
# ‚úÖ What You Did Well

# Basic class structure is correct
# Object interaction is working (Library calls Book methods)
# Core functionality is implemented
# Testing approach shows good understanding
# Incremental development (leaving complex parts for later) is smart

# ‚ùå Issues to Fix
# 1. Method Name Inconsistency
# python# Your Book class has:
# def returnbook(self):  # No underscore

# # But requirements specify:
# def return_book(self):  # With underscore
# 2. Logical Error in borrow_book()
# python# Your current implementation:
# def borrow_book(self, title, borrower):
#     book_found, book = self.find_book(title)
#     if book_found and book.is_available : 
#         book.borrower = borrower        # ‚ùå Direct attribute modification
#         book.is_available = False       # ‚ùå Direct attribute modification
#         return f"{book.title} by {book.author} borrowed by `{borrower}`successfully"
# Problem: You're bypassing the Book's borrow() method and directly modifying attributes. This breaks encapsulation.
# Better approach:
# pythondef borrow_book(self, title, borrower):
#     book_found, book = self.find_book(title)
#     if book_found:
#         return book.borrow(borrower)  # Use Book's method
#     else:
#         return f"Book '{title}' not found"
# 3. find_book() Return Format
# python# Your current implementation:
# def find_book(self, title):
#     for book in self.collection:
#         if book.title == title:
#             return True, book  # ‚ùå Returns tuple
#     else:
#         return False, None
# Problem: Requirements specify it should return the Book object if found, not a tuple.
# Better approach:
# pythondef find_book(self, title):
#     for book in self.collection:
#         if book.title.lower() == title.lower():  # Case-insensitive
#             return book
#     return None  # Book not found
# 4. Missing self Parameter
# pythondef is_overdue():  # ‚ùå Missing self parameter
#     pass
# Should be:
# pythondef is_overdue(self):
#     pass
# 5. Logic Error in get_available_books()
# python# Your current logic:
# if len(self.collection) != 0:
#     # ... find available books
# else:
#     return "All books are borrowed at the moment ! "  # ‚ùå Wrong logic
# Problem: If collection is empty, it doesn't mean all books are borrowed - it means there are no books!
# Better approach:
# pythondef get_available_books(self):
#     available = []
#     for book in self.collection:
#         if book.is_available:
#             available.append(book)
#     return available
# 6. Inconsistent Variable Names
# python# You use both:
# avilable_books = []  # ‚ùå Typo in "available"
# self.collection = []  # Different from requirements (should be self.books)
# 7. Missing return_book() Method in Library
# Your Library class is missing the return_book() method that's required.
# üîß Key Corrections Needed
# Fix the Library Class Methods:
# pythondef borrow_book(self, title, borrower):
#     book = self.find_book(title)
#     if book:
#         return book.borrow(borrower)  # Use Book's method
#     else:
#         return f"Book '{title}' not found"

# def return_book(self, title):
#     book = self.find_book(title)
#     if book:
#         return book.return_book()  # Use Book's method
#     else:
#         return f"Book '{title}' not found"

# def get_available_books(self):
#     return [book for book in self.collection if book.is_available]
# Fix the Book Class:
# pythondef return_book(self):  # Fix method name
#     if not self.is_available:
#         self.is_available = True
#         borrower = self.borrower
#         self.borrower = None
#         self.due_date = None
#         return f"{self.title} returned by {borrower}"
#     else:
#         return f"{self.title} was not borrowed"
# üéØ Key Learning Points

# Use Object Methods: When Library needs to change Book state, call Book methods rather than directly modifying attributes
# Consistent Naming: Follow the exact method names specified in requirements
# Proper Encapsulation: Let each object manage its own state
# Return Appropriate Types: Methods should return what they promise (find_book should return Book object, not tuple)

# üöÄ Next Steps

# Fix the method names and missing methods
# Use proper object interaction (Library calls Book methods)
# Add the missing return_book() method to Library
# Test the return functionality
# Then tackle the date logic for due dates

# Your core understanding is solid - these are mostly implementation details that need polishing. The object interaction concept is working well!
