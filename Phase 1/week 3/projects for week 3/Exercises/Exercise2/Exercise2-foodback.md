# what to add and refactor next

### üß± PRODUCT ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN
 Delegate SKU generation logic to child classes ‚Äî avoid relying on isinstance() in the base class.

 Centralize and standardize validation for price, name, quantity, etc. across all product types.

 Separate concerns: product attributes (data) vs. operations (discount, tax, shipping).

 Ensure all abstract methods in base class are implemented clearly with no redundancy or duplication.

### üßÆ DISCOUNT & PRICE HANDLING
 Stop modifying price directly when applying discounts ‚Äî make discount application non-destructive.

 Introduce a cart-level discount mechanism, not per-product.

 Allow validation of discount codes before applying.

 Support stacking or chaining discounts using design patterns (optional stretch: use Decorator or Strategy).

### üì¶ SHOPPING CART LOGIC
 Allow adding multiple quantities of the same product, not just one instance per product.

 Track quantities separately, not by duplicating objects.

 Move all cart-level calculations to dedicated methods (e.g., total before tax, tax total, shipping total).

 Separate state-changing operations (add/remove) from validation and reporting.

### üßæ ORDER & PAYMENT FLOW
 Integrate tax into final total calculations.

 Build a robust order summary method that returns quantity, unit price, subtotal, tax, shipping, and final line total per item.

 Improve timestamp and UUID formatting for clarity.

 Avoid duplicating cart validation logic across payment processors ‚Äî extract this check into a shared utility.

### üß™ VALIDATION & ERROR HANDLING
 Enforce strong validation in constructors and public methods.

 Raise meaningful, specific errors when validation fails.

 Catch and log validation errors during runtime testing instead of allowing silent failures.

 Ensure failure paths are tested just as thoroughly as success paths.

### üßº CLEAN CODE & PROFESSIONAL PRACTICES
 Remove commented-out code and unnecessary prints.

 Improve method and variable naming consistency.

 Add type hints to all function arguments and return values.

 Implement __str__ and __repr__ consistently and purposefully.

 Structure your codebase into modules (products.py, cart.py, payments.py, etc.).

### üß™ TESTING COVERAGE
 Write clear test cases for each major component: product creation, discount application, cart totals, shipping costs, payment processing.

 Add edge case tests: invalid prices, missing names, zero quantities, invalid discount codes.

 Ensure test outputs are verified against expected values, especially for pricing, tax, and shipping logic.

 Create mock orders with combinations of digital and physical products to simulate real usage.

### üß≠ OPTIONAL STRETCH GOALS (IF TIME ALLOWS)
 Implement strategy pattern for dynamic tax/shipping rules.

 Add unit testing suite using unittest or pytest.

 Integrate basic logging instead of print statements for real-world tracking.

 Include JSON import/export of cart and orders to simulate persistence layer.
