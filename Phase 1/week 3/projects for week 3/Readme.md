Exercise 1: Library Management System
Difficulty: Beginner-Intermediate
Class Responsibilities:
Book Class:

Store book information (title, author, ISBN, publication year, genre)
Track availability status (available/checked out)
Handle book checkout/return operations
Validate ISBN format (must be 13 digits)

Member Class:

Store member information (name, member ID, email, join date)
Track books currently borrowed by the member
Enforce borrowing limits (max 3 books per member)
Calculate membership duration

Library Class:

Manage collections of books and members
Handle book search operations (by title, author, or genre)
Process checkout/return transactions
Generate reports (overdue books, popular genres)
Validate member credentials

Key OOP Concepts to Apply:

Encapsulation: Use private/protected attributes for internal data
Abstraction: Hide complex search and validation logic
Inheritance: Consider if you need different types of books or members
Polymorphism: Different search methods that work uniformly

Modules to Import:

datetime for handling dates
re for ISBN validation
collections for counting/organizing data

How It Should Work:
The system should allow librarians to add books, register members, process checkouts/returns, and generate basic reports. Members shouldn't be able to borrow more than 3 books or check out unavailable books.
Extra Challenge: Implement a book reservation system where members can reserve books that are currently checked out.

Exercise 2: Online Shopping Cart with Payment Processing
Difficulty: Intermediate
Class Responsibilities:
Product Class (Abstract Base):

Store common product attributes (name, price, SKU, description)
Define abstract methods for tax calculation and shipping costs
Handle price validation

DigitalProduct Class (inherits Product):

No shipping costs
Immediate delivery
Different tax rates
File size and download link attributes

PhysicalProduct Class (inherits Product):

Weight and dimensions for shipping calculation
Inventory tracking
Shipping costs based on weight/size

ShoppingCart Class:

Add/remove products
Calculate subtotals, taxes, and shipping
Apply discount codes
Validate cart contents before checkout

PaymentProcessor Class (Abstract Base):

Define common payment interface
Handle payment validation

CreditCardProcessor & PayPalProcessor Classes:

Implement specific payment methods
Different validation rules
Different fee structures

Order Class:

Store order details and history
Track order status
Calculate final totals

Key OOP Concepts to Apply:

Abstraction: Abstract base classes for products and payments
Inheritance: Multiple product types with shared behavior
Polymorphism: Different payment methods with same interface
Encapsulation: Protected pricing and payment information

Modules to Import:

abc for abstract base classes
enum for order status and payment types
decimal for precise money calculations
uuid for generating unique IDs
datetime for order timestamps

How It Should Work:
Users can add different types of products to their cart, apply discounts, choose payment methods, and complete purchases. The system should handle different tax rates, shipping costs, and payment processing fees.
Extra Challenge: Implement a decorator pattern for dynamic discount application (percentage off, buy-one-get-one, seasonal discounts) that can be stacked.

Exercise 3: Task Management System with User Roles and Notifications
Difficulty: Intermediate-Advanced
Class Responsibilities:
User Class (Abstract Base):

Store user information (username, email, password hash)
Define abstract methods for permission checking
Handle authentication

Admin, Manager, Employee Classes (inherit User):

Different permission levels
Role-specific methods
Different task creation/modification rights

Task Class:

Store task details (title, description, priority, deadline, status)
Track assignee and creator
Handle status transitions with validation
Calculate time remaining

Project Class:

Manage collections of tasks
Track project progress
Handle project-level permissions
Generate project reports

NotificationService Class (Singleton):

Send different types of notifications
Track notification history
Handle notification preferences

TaskObserver Classes (Observer Pattern):

EmailNotifier, SlackNotifier, SMSNotifier
React to task status changes
Different notification formats

TaskFactory Class:

Create different types of tasks (Bug, Feature, Meeting, etc.)
Apply appropriate templates and defaults
Validate task creation parameters

Key OOP Concepts to Apply:

Abstraction: Abstract user roles and notification systems
Inheritance: User hierarchy with different permissions
Polymorphism: Multiple notification methods and task types
Encapsulation: Protected user data and task modification methods
Design Patterns: Observer pattern for notifications, Factory for task creation, Singleton for notification service

Modules to Import:

abc for abstract base classes
enum for task status, priority, and user roles
datetime for deadlines and timestamps
hashlib for password hashing
functools for decorators (permission checking)
threading for thread-safe singleton
collections for task queues and history

How It Should Work:
Users with different roles can create, assign, and manage tasks within projects. The system should enforce role-based permissions, send appropriate notifications when tasks change status, and provide progress tracking.
Extra Challenge: Implement a command pattern for task operations (create, update, delete, assign) with undo/redo functionality and operation logging.
