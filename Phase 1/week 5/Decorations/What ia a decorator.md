## 5 decorators you should use 

### Property decorator 

- `@property` 
- This will let use create a mthod as if it was a an attribute
- **Specially when we have a privet atrribute in a class to get the value we can use a propery decorator to access**
- There are getters and setter in property decorators as well as to set a value to a privet attribute without acessing directly
- Example - url

### Staticmethod decorator

- `@staticmethod`
- only used to know if a method inside a class is static
- To say method belong to class but not the instance
