- **Features:**
  - Interactive menu system
  - Append mode to preserve data
  - Line counting and character counting
  - Delete functionality for specific entries
- **Skills Learned:**
  - Basic file I/O operations (`open`, `read`, `write`)
  - Using `with` statement for proper file handling
  - String manipulation and user input validation

### Exercise 2: Simple Logging System
**Files:** `exercise2.py`, `data.txt`
- **Objective:** Create a timestamp-based logging system
- **Features:**
  - Automatic timestamp generation using `datetime`
  - Log entry creation and viewing
  - Proper file path handling with `pathlib.Path`
- **Skills Learned:**
  - Working with datetime module
  - File existence checking with `touch(exist_ok=True)`
  - Formatted string output with timestamps

### Exercise 3: CSV File Basics
**Files:** `exercise3.py`, `data.csv`
- **Objective:** Handle student grade data using CSV format
- **Features:**
  - CSV file creation with headers
  - Adding student records (ID, name, grade)
  - Reading and displaying CSV data
  - Proper CSV formatting with `newline=""` parameter
- **Skills Learned:**
  - `csv.writer` and `csv.reader` modules
  - Header row management
  - Structured data storage

### Exercise 4: Advanced CSV & JSON Integration
**Files:** `exercise4.py`, `student_data.csv`, `student_data.json`
- **Objective:** Convert CSV data to JSON format and work with dictionaries
- **Features:**
  - CSV to JSON conversion
  - Dictionary-based data reading with `csv.DictReader`
  - JSON file creation and manipulation
  - Data formatting and pretty printing
- **Skills Learned:**
  - `csv.DictReader` for structured data access
  - `json.dump` and `json.load` operations
  - Data format conversion techniques

### Exercise 5: Object-Oriented Quiz Game System
**Files:** `exercise5.py`, `main.py`, `questions.json`, `score_board.json`, `__init__.py`
- **Objective:** Build a complete quiz game with question management and scoring
- **Features:**
  - Class-based architecture (`QuizzGame` class)
  - Question CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  - Score tracking and player management
  - JSON file persistence
  - Modular design with separate main file
- **Skills Learned:**
  - Object-oriented programming with file handling
  - JSON data manipulation
  - Complex data structures (lists of dictionaries)
  - Error handling and data validation
  - Module separation and imports

## üéØ Learning Progression

1. **Basic File Operations** ‚Üí Text files, read/write modes
2. **Data Formatting** ‚Üí Timestamps, structured logging
3. **Structured Data** ‚Üí CSV format, headers, data integrity
4. **Data Conversion** ‚Üí CSV to JSON, dictionary handling
5. **Advanced Systems** ‚Üí OOP, complex data management, persistence

## üîß Key Python Concepts Demonstrated

- File I/O operations (`open`, `with` statements)
- Error handling (`try/except`)
- Data serialization (CSV, JSON)
- Object-oriented programming
- Module organization
- Path management (`pathlib.Path`)
- String manipulation and validation
- Data structure manipulation (lists, dictionaries)

## üìö Supporting Theory

Refer to the Theory folder for detailed explanations:
- `txt_file_handling.md` - Text file operations and best practices
- `csv_file_handling.md` - CSV module usage and data handling
- `json_file_handling.md` - JSON operations and data structures

## üöÄ Getting Started

Each exercise is self-contained. Start with Exercise 1 and work through them sequentially:

```bash
# Run individual exercises
python Exercise1.py
python exercise2.py
python exercise3.py
python exercise4.py

# For Exercise 5 (modular design)
python main.py
```

## üìù Notes

- All exercises include proper error handling
- File paths are configured for the local development environment
- Each exercise demonstrates progressive complexity
- Code includes detailed comments explaining functionality
- Exercises cover both procedural and object-oriented approaches
